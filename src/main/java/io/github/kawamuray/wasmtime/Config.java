    /// then wasm memory will be dynamically located and may move in memory
    /// through growth operations.

    /// may be relocated through `memory.grow`. Also note that if any wasm
    /// memory's maximum size is below `maxSize` then it will still reserve
    /// `maxSize` bytes in the virtual memory space.
    ///
    /// ## Static vs Dynamic Memory
    ///
    /// Linear memories represent contiguous arrays of bytes, but they can also
    /// be grown through the API and wasm instructions. When memory is grown if
    /// space hasn't been preallocated then growth may involve relocating the
    /// base pointer in memory. Memories in Wasmtime are classified in two
    /// different ways:
    ///
    /// * **static** - these memories preallocate all space necessary they'll
    ///   ever need, meaning that the base pointer of these memories is never
    ///   moved. Static memories may take more virtual memory space because of
    ///   pre-reserving space for memories.
    ///
    /// * **dynamic** - these memories are not preallocated and may move during
    ///   growth operations. Dynamic memories consume less virtual memory space
    ///   because they don't need to preallocate space for future growth.
    ///
    /// Static memories can be optimized better in JIT code because once the
    /// base address is loaded in a function it's known that we never need to
    /// reload it because it never changes, `memory.grow` is generally a pretty
    /// fast operation because the wasm memory is never relocated, and under
    /// some conditions bounds checks can be elided on memory accesses.
    ///
    /// Dynamic memories can't be quite as heavily optimized because the base
    /// address may need to be reloaded more often, they may require relocating
    /// lots of data on `memory.grow`, and dynamic memories require
    /// unconditional bounds checks on all memory accesses.
    ///
    /// ## Should you use static or dynamic memory?
    ///
    /// In general you probably don't need to change the value of this property.
    /// The defaults here are optimized for each target platform to consume a
    /// reasonable amount of physical memory while also generating speedy
    /// machine code.
    ///
    /// One of the main reasons you may want to configure this today is if your
    /// environment can't reserve virtual memory space for each wasm linear
    /// memory. On 64-bit platforms wasm memories require a 6GB reservation by
    /// default, and system limits may prevent this in some scenarios. In this
    /// case you may wish to force memories to be allocated dynamically meaning
    /// that the virtual memory footprint of creating a wasm memory should be
    /// exactly what's used by the wasm itself.
    ///
    /// For 32-bit memories a static memory must contain at least 4GB of
    /// reserved address space plus a guard page to elide any bounds checks at
    /// all. Smaller static memories will use similar bounds checks as dynamic
    /// memories.
    ///
    /// ## Default
    ///
    /// The default value for this property depends on the host platform. For
    /// 64-bit platforms there's lots of address space available, so the default
    /// configured here is 4GB. WebAssembly linear memories currently max out at
    /// 4GB which means that on 64-bit platforms Wasmtime by default always uses
    /// a static memory. This, coupled with a sufficiently sized guard region,
    /// should produce the fastest JIT code on 64-bit platforms, but does
    /// require a large address space reservation for each wasm memory.
    ///
    /// For 32-bit platforms this value defaults to 1GB. This means that wasm
    /// memories whose maximum size is less than 1GB will be allocated
    /// statically, otherwise they'll be considered dynamic.
    public native Config staticMemoryMaximumSize(long maxSize);

    /// Configures the size, in bytes, of the guard region used at the end of a
    /// static memory's address space reservation.
    ///
    /// All WebAssembly loads/stores are bounds-checked and generate a trap if
    /// they're out-of-bounds. Loads and stores are often very performance
    /// critical, so we want the bounds check to be as fast as possible!
    /// Accelerating these memory accesses is the motivation for a guard after a
    /// memory allocation.
    ///
    /// Memories (both static and dynamic) can be configured with a guard at the
    /// end of them which consists of unmapped virtual memory. This unmapped
    /// memory will trigger a memory access violation (e.g. segfault) if
    /// accessed. This allows JIT code to elide bounds checks if it can prove
    /// that an access, if out of bounds, would hit the guard region. This means
    /// that having such a guard of unmapped memory can remove the need for
    /// bounds checks in JIT code.

    ///
    /// In general, like with configuring `staticMemoryMaximumSize`, you
    /// probably don't want to change this value from the defaults. Otherwise,
    /// though, the size of the guard region affects the number of bounds checks
    /// needed for generated wasm code. More specifically, loads/stores with
    /// immediate offsets will generate bounds checks based on how big the guard
    /// page is.
    ///
    /// For 32-bit memories a 4GB static memory is required to even start
    /// removing bounds checks. A 4GB guard size will guarantee that the module
    /// has zero bounds checks for memory accesses. A 2GB guard size will
    /// eliminate all bounds checks with an immediate offset less than 2GB. A
    /// guard size of zero means that all memory accesses will still have bounds
    /// checks.

    /// ## Default
